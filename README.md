**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

This special adapter was developed for the KISSHome defender project. It is not intended for general use.

To use this adapter, you must first register on the [KISSHome defender](https://kisshome-defender.if-is.net) website and get the confirmation email.

To run this adapter, you need:

-   More than 3 smart home devices
-   Fritz!Box Router. Without `Fritz!Box`, the adapter will not work.
-   iobroker must run on debian/raspbian (or at least on linux, where the following commands are available: `which`, `rsync`)
-   Docker must be installed and enabled for the user `iobroker` to run the IDS container

### Enable Docker for user iobroker
By older Linux systems to install docker, you must do the following [steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

By new systems (Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04 and newer) you can install docker by the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker  
sudo usermod -aG docker iobroker
```

Add command docker to the sudoers file:
```bash
sudo visudo /etc/sudoers.d/iobroker
```

Add the following line:
```text
iobroker ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/docker
```
